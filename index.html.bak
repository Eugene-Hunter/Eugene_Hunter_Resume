					<h3>Bio</h3>
					<p>I am a certified A+ computer technician with 22 years experience. I am currently studying to 
					become a certified System Engineer.				 
					I have 12 years working experience as a tax return assessor/auditor for the South African 
					Revenue Services, as well as being self-employed and the sole director of a company since 
					my resignation at SARS in 2016.</p>
					
					<p>I have a pleasant demeanor and as an ambivert I enjoy working alongside other people as well
					as working alone without supervision. I aim to please and am punctual and presentable. I am also very diplomatic and I take great pride in my work.</p>
					 
					<p>I am very focused to successfully complete the tasks assigned to me and am also deadline driven.  
					I am analytically inclined and someone who enjoys a challenge. 
					My personality is that of an INFJ-A according to the Meyers Briggs Personality Test which  is a 100% 
					accurate reflection.</p>
